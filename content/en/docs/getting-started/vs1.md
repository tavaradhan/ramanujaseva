<b> अशेषचिदचिद्वस्तुशेषिणे शेषशायिने । <br>
निर्मलानन्तकल्याण निधये विष्णवे नमः ॥ १ ॥ </b>

I offer adoration to Visnu, the all-pervading supreme Being, who is the overlord of all sentient and non-sentient entities, who reposes on the primordial Seșa, who is pure and infinite and in whom abound blissful perfections. (1)


**परं ब्रह्मैवाज्ञं भ्रमपरिगतं संसरति तत् परोपाध्यालीढं विवशमशुभस्यास्पदमिति |** \
**श्रुतिन्यायापेतं जगति विततं मोहनमिदम् तमो येनापास्तं स हि विजयते यामुनमुनिः ॥ २ ॥**


Gloriously triumphs the sage Yāmuna, who dispelled the delusive darkness filling the world in the shape of doctrines devoid of both scriptural authority and reason maintaining that (a) the highest Brahman itself is bereft of knowledge and is caught up in illusion and hence wanders in the realm of transmigration, (b) it is conditioned by an alien adjunct and is rendered helpless and that (c) it has become the seat of evil. (2)

1. The crown of Vedas i.e., The Upanişads, which lays down the good of the whole world, enshrines this truth: A seeker, after first acquiring a true understanding of the individual self and the Supreme and equipped with the performance of the duties pertaining to his station in life, must devote himself to the meditation, worship and adoring salutation of the blessed feet of the supreme Person. This done with immeasurable joy leads to the attainment of the Supreme.
The individual self is subject to beginningless nescience, which has brought about an accumulation of karma, of the nature of both merit and demerit. The flood of such karma causes his entry into four kinds of bodies-heavenly, human, animal and plant beginning with that of Brahma downwards. This ingression into bodies produces the delution of identity with those respective bodies (and the consequent attachments and aversions). This delution inevitably brings about all the fears inherent in the state of worldly existence. The entire body of Vedānta aims at the annihilation of these fears. To accomplish their annihilation they teach the following: (1) The essential nature of the individual self as transcending the body. (2) The attributes of the individual self. (3) The essential nature of the Supreme that is the inmost controller of both the material universe and the individual selves. (4) The attributes of the Supreme. (5) The devout meditation upon the Supreme. (6) The goal to which such meditation leads. The Vedanta aims at making known the goal attainable through such a life of meditation, the goal being the realization, of the real nature of the individual self and after and through that realization, the direct experience of Brahman, which is of the nature of bliss infinite and perfect. The passages to this effect may be illustrated by the following : 'That thou art (Chā. VI, IX, 4)’; ‘This self is Brahman (Br. VI, IV, 5)’; ‘He who dwells in the self, who is in the self, whom the self does not know, whose body this self is, who rules this self from within, that one is your self, the inner Ruler, the Immortal. (Br. V, VII) '; 'He is the inner self of all creatures, free from all imperfections, the divine, the sole God Nārāyana (Su. VII)'; “The Brāhmanas desire to know this one, through the study of the Vedas, through sacrifices, charity, austerities and fasting ( Br. VI, IV, 22)’; “The knower of Brahman attains the Highest (Tai. II, 1)’; ‘He who knows him thus attains immortality here. There is no other pathway to this goal (Pu. VII)'.

2. The essential nature of the individual self is devoid of the manifold distinctions pertaining to the various modifications of material nature constitutive of the bodies of the various kinds like heavenly and human. It has only knowledge and bliss as its attributes. When the bodily differentiations born of karma are destroyed, the essential individuality, indescribable but self-cognized, can only be represented as of the 'nature of consciousness (Vi, I, IV, 40)'. This essential nature is common to all individual selves.
This world, of the aforesaid nature, consisting of spiritual and physical entities, has the supreme Spirit, as the ground of its origination, maintenance, destruction and of the liberation of the individual from transmigratory existence. He, the supreme One, is unique, transcending in character every other entity, because his nature is opposed to all evil and is of the sole nature of supreme bliss. He is the abode of countless auspicious attributes unsurpassed in their perfection. He is Bhagavan Näārāyaṇa, the highest Spirit. He is presented by the entire Vedanta, through variations of terminology as the 'Soul of all', 'Highest Brahman', 'Highest Light', 'Highest Reality', 'Highest Self' and 'Being'. Such is the nature of the inner Controller. The Vedas devoted to the exposition of his glory, expound the fact that he controls all entities, sentient as well as non-sentient, as their indwelling self. (They do it in two ways): (1) They describe them as his power', 'part', 'splendour', 'form', 'body' and 'organism' and through such other terms. (2) They also affirm the oneness of these entities with him.

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |

| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"{`      |

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.
